SIGNALIR 
Add real-time web capabilities to your ASP.NET Core apps.
Where is the Middleware?
startup.cs

Kestrel webserver using to host on multiple environments.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel?view=aspnetcore-2.2

startup.cs consist of 2 methods..
1.configureservices(will have mvc, identity)
2.configure (all the middleware components)


service is a component that is availible for common usage..
It will use dependency Injection concepts..

why we need inversion control pattern in C#?

High level module does not depends on low level modules.

aspcore will use dependencyInjection pattern ..

it will register the services and instance that one when it is needed..
